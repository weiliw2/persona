# Materials Folder

Drop your assets here before running the setup script. The AI will use these to build your portfolio.

## What to Include

### `/images`
- **profile.jpg** or **profile.png** - Your headshot/profile photo
- **project-*.jpg/png** - Screenshots of your projects
- **og-image.jpg/png** - Social share image (optional)

### `/documents`
- **resume.pdf** - Your current resume (the AI will extract info from this)
- **bio.txt** - A personal bio or "about me" text if you have one written
- **projects.txt** - List of projects with descriptions (optional)

## File Naming

Keep filenames simple and descriptive:
- ✅ `profile.jpg`, `ecommerce-app.png`, `resume.pdf`
- ❌ `IMG_0234.jpg`, `Screenshot 2024-01-15 at 3.42.18 PM.png`

## The AI Will

1. Extract information from your resume
2. Use your profile photo in the hero section
3. Add project screenshots to the bento grid
4. Reference any bio or project descriptions you provide
5. Generate missing content based on what it finds

## Optional

If you don't provide materials, the AI will work with just your GitHub/LinkedIn and generate everything from scratch. Materials just make it better.
